# Decomposition and Abstraction

## Decomposition

Decomposition is the act of taking an idea/program and breaking into smaller usable parts.

Different components work together to achieve an end goal. 


## Abstraction

Abstraction is knowing how a program works but not exactly knowing what's inside. This concept is very useful for turning ideas into code.

You typically know the input/output behavior

It's the idea that once something is built, I don't need to know what's inside. As long I know how it works.
