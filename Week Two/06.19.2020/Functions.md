# Decomposition and Abstraction

## Decomposition

Decomposition is the act of taking an idea/program and breaking into smaller usable parts.

Different components work together to achieve an end goal. 


## Abstraction

Abstraction is knowing how a program works but not exactly knowing what's inside. This concept is very useful for turning ideas into code.

You typically know the input/output behavior

It's the idea that once something is built, I don't need to know what's inside. As long I know how it works.

## More
Will achieve decomposition via functions and later on via classes

We will also achieve abstraction by using function specifications and docstrings

Decomposition and abstraction are powerful together and can be reused multiple times to create clean and efficient code!
