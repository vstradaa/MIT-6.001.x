# Decomposition and Abstraction

## Decomposition

Decomposition is the act of taking an idea/program and breaking into smaller usable parts.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the act of knowing how a program works but not exactly knowing what's inside. This concept is very useful for turning ideas into code.
